#### What is this?
It’s a collection of links. Each link shows you a list of your Facebook friends who like a particular Facebook page.

#### Why make this?
We got tired of manually unfriending people who have garbage ideas, so we decided to make it a little easier to find them.

#### Wait, unfriending? Will clicking the links unfriend people?

No, clicking the links just shows you a list. What you choose to do after that is up to you.

#### What if I don’t want to unfriend people?

You don’t have to. Again, you can do what you want with this information.

#### Does Facebook notify people if they’ve been unfriended?

No.

#### This isn’t activism. Why not go out and actually do something?

You’re right, it’s absolutely not activism. But neither is arguing on Facebook with your chemistry lab partner from 9th grade about whether or not Obama is a Reptilian Overlord. We think using social media to engage with your *actual* friends is a healthier way to live.

#### You’re a libtard/snowflake/SJW/beta cuck. I’m going to make my own version of this page and change all the links to liberal garbage instead. What do you think of that?

We strongly support this. In the end, the results are the same.

#### I’m a wishy-washy milquetoast moderate, and am now in the reconciliation and acceptance phase of the post-election landscape. I’m really proud to have friends from all political persuasions (and I share this holier-than-thou sentiment loudly and often). How can your site help me?

It probably can’t. But we take inspiration from Dr. King:

> First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season.

> Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."



#### Doesn’t this break the spirit of Facebook?

Facebook doesn’t have a spirit. It’s a company that sells advertising. How we choose to use it is up to us. This election has fundamentally changed the nature of political conversation, and we’re not interested in being “friends" with garbage anymore. Our real friends are people we share values with as adults, not people we shared a zip code with in high school.


#### Why does your code suck/why didn’t you include [some other garbage page]?

It’s barely code at all. We’re not developers. We threw this together really quickly (although much more slowly than developers would have). Please fork it and make it better.
